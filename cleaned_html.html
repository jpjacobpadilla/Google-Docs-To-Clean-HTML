<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use Google Cloud’s free-tier virtual machine to deploy a docker image of <a href="https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Uptime Kuma</a> - an excellent open-source monitoring solution. Then, I’ll show you how to set up a monitor for any website, using my own site as an example. Lastly, I will set up Slack notification alerts to be quickly notified if there’s anything wrong with my site.</p>
<p>It’s about time I set up monitoring and alerting for my website - It’s extremely important for any service, as you need to know when something isn’t working.</p>
<p>So let’s dive into it:</p>

<h1 id="set-up-a-google-cloud-account">Set Up a Google Cloud Account</h1>

    <p>The first thing you'll need to do is create a <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Google Cloud account</a>. Once you've created an account, type “compute engine” into the search bar:</p>

    <p>Then, you will need to select a project (I chose the pre-made “personal projects” one). In Google Cloud, projects are essentially organizational units designed to neatly compartmentalize and manage your resources, APIs, users, and billing for different initiatives.</p>
    <p>After selecting a project in the top right of the page, you should see the screen below. Since we're using Google Cloud's compute engine (their basic virtual machine service) you'll need to enable that specific API.</p>

    <p>At this point, Google Cloud will probably ask you to enter in some billing information. However, the monitoring solution I'm making in this article fits within the free tier specifications, so you shouldn't be charged anything.</p>

    <p>Once the compute engine API is turned on (which may take a minute), click the hamburger menu on the top right, then go to “Compute Engine” and then “VM Instance.“ This page is where you'll be able to view, create, and manage all of your virtual machines!</p>
